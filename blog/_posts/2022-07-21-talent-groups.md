Greetings,

double Stormkeeper was clarified. I'm not yet sure how to feel about that. That's gonna be a lot of burst in PvP. But certainly an interesting choice in PvE.

Additionally I doodled. Marking talents as

Color | Group
--- | ---
red | Lava Burst + Flame Shock
blue | Lightning
green | Spenders
pink | Frost spell school

# Lava Burst + Flame Shock

![](https://stormearthandlava.com/assets/img/blog/10_alpha/talent_grouping_fire.png)

While I had to mark Flames of the Firelord (Flame Shock CD reduction) as a talent technically fitting this category, it's almost worthless when combined with any of the following

- Fire Elemental (assuming missing duration doubling is a bug)
- Liquid Magma Totem
- Deeply Rooted Elements
- Primordial Wave (even worse with Tumbling Waves).

Master of the Elements is activated by Lava Burst, but the more one focuses on Fire the less impact this talent has. And it's starting weak already.

Talents that feel like meaningless fillers:

- 1x Call of Fire (+10% Fire for specific spells)
- 1x Improved Flametongue Weapon (+5% Fire)
- 2x Flames of the Firelord (Flame Shock CD reduction)

To me it's very noticeable how much of the tree is dedicated to Lava. Feels like 2/3.

# Lightning

Storm Elemental to the far right, locked behind three or four (depending on if you count Fire Elemental) Lava talents. That's a lot of non-lightning points spent into getting Storm Elemental. It feels like a misfit here.

Neither Primal Elementalist nor Skybreaker's Fiery Demise directly affect the Lighting playstyle, but they empower Storm Elemental. That's why they are partially marked. Skybreakers encouragement to spread Flame Shock is a detriment to Storm Elemental itself. Somewhat mitigated by Magma Chamber but certainly not enough in it's current iteration/tuning.

I'm once again unhappy about High Voltage (additional Maelstrom generation for Lightning Bolt). This talent is in a location that forces the player to take it with only Icefury and Swelling Maelstrom as an alternative. As pointed out in the previous blogpost in my opinion Swelling Maelstrom is pointless to have. Icefury introduces two additional buttons to the priority list. That can be too much for some. Therefore these two talents might be actively avoided forcing the pick of High Voltage for Lightning Bolt to powercreep in the direction of Lava Burst. (Now Lightning Bolt generates as much resources as Lava Burst.) While this is good for a Lightning based build, it's super weird in general to see any form of creep of Lightning Bolt to Lava Burst.

Nature is focused on the left side. Which is good.

# Frost / Multischool spells

Icefury's choice node are neat as they allow it to either fit into a Lightning or Lava build. Lightning is the AoE Choice, Lava the single target one.

Elemental Blast sitting right next to Elemental Equilibrium basically calls for combining them. Tuning will determine if the later will be able to compete with all these other options in the tree. Especially for having to invest 2 point into Elemental Equilibrium to get its full value.

# Spenders

Aftershock being in the centre of the tree will probably result in everyone taking it. And as long as our spenders are stronger than our builders this talent **will** be an auto-pick. I'm struggling to see a reason to not pick it. Especially because how difficult it is to spend 20 points before we're finally able to head into the last three rows. Difficult in this case means "I have to invest points into something I don't want to unlock the gate".

Eye of the Storm, Elemental Blast, Windspeaker's Lava Resurgence, and Echoes of Great Sundering all sitting in the bottom left corner feels overloaded because all of them are very strong effects.

Coming from Shadowlands Windspeaker's is the all expansion long dominating single target Legendary. Echoes of Great Sundering is the all expansion long dominating AoE Legendary. And I don't see other effects in tree that can compete with them. Now both effects sit next to each other. This enables us to have both at the same time. EoGS for AoE during a fight or m+ run while still having access to WLR once the target count drops low enough. That's a lot of power. Especially when a cost reduction for them is right next to them. I believe either this is too strong and therefore dominating the tree in the long run, or the other side seriously needs more power.

# Combined

![](https://stormearthandlava.com/assets/img/blog/10_alpha/talent_grouping_fire_nature_frost_spenders.png)

Lava has a lot of points. Lightning and spenders have a lot of power but are required to take Lava points just to breach gates. Or either are required to take Icefury. Therefore the top and upper middle section feel pretty pushy between lesser evils rather than cool choices. :(

Yours sincerely,
